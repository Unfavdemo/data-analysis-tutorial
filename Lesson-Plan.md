# Section 1: What is Next.js? (15 minutes)

## 🎯 **Learning Objective**
Students will understand what Next.js is, why it was created, and how it differs from plain React.

---

## 📊 **Slide 1: Title Slide**

```
Module 1: React vs Next.js
From Client-Side to Full-Stack

Instructor: [Your Name]
Duration: 90-120 minutes
```

---

## 📊 **Slide 2: The React Story**

**Title:** React - The UI Library

**Content:**
- Created by Facebook (Meta) in 2013
- Solves: Building complex user interfaces
- Focus: **Component-based** UI development
- Runs: **In the browser** (client-side)

**Visual:**
```
User's Browser
    ↓
React App Loads
    ↓
JavaScript Builds the Page
    ↓
User Sees Content
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"React revolutionized how we build user interfaces by letting us create reusable components. But React is just a library - it only handles the UI layer. You still need to figure out routing, data fetching, server setup, and deployment yourself."

---

## 📊 **Slide 3: The Problem React Doesn't Solve**

**Title:** What React Doesn't Give You

**Content:**
❌ No built-in routing system  
❌ No server-side rendering (SEO problems)  
❌ No backend API endpoints  
❌ No optimized production builds  
❌ No automatic code splitting  

**Example Scenario:**
```
You build a product catalog in React...
- Google can't see your products (bad SEO)
- First page load is slow (downloads all JS first)
- You need separate backend (Express, etc.)
- You manually configure Webpack
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Imagine you built an e-commerce site with React. Search engines would have trouble finding your products because they're generated by JavaScript. Your users would see a blank page while JavaScript loads. You'd need to set up a separate backend server for your API. This is where Next.js comes in."

---

## 📊 **Slide 4: Enter Next.js**

**Title:** Next.js - The React Framework

**Content:**
- Created by Vercel in 2016
- Built **on top of** React
- Solves: Everything React doesn't
- Philosophy: **Full-stack** framework

**Visual:**
```
Next.js Framework
    ├── React (UI components)
    ├── Router (built-in)
    ├── Server (API routes)
    ├── Optimizer (automatic)
    └── Deployment (Vercel)
```

**Key Point:**
> Next.js is to React what Rails is to Ruby, or Django is to Python

**Speaker Notes:**
"Next.js doesn't replace React - it extends it. You still write React components, but Next.js adds routing, server-side rendering, API endpoints, and optimizations out of the box. Think of React as the engine, and Next.js as the complete car."

---

## 📊 **Slide 5: Why Should You Care?**

**Title:** Why Learn Next.js?

**Real-World Usage:**
- **TikTok** - Uses Next.js for web app
- **Notion** - Uses Next.js for marketing site

# Section 2: React vs Next.js - Core Differences (20 minutes)

## 🎯 **Learning Objective**
Students will understand the architectural differences between React and Next.js applications.

---

## 📊 **Slide 6: Architecture Comparison**

**Title:** How They're Built Differently

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**

| Aspect | React | Next.js |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Type** | UI Library | Full-stack Framework |
| **Runs** | Client-only | Client + Server |
| **Routing** | Need React Router | Built-in (file-based) |
| **Rendering** | CSR only | CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR |
| **API** | Separate backend | Built-in API routes |
| **Setup** | Manual (Vite, CRA) | One command |

**Visual:**

```
REACT APP:
Browser → React App → Manual Routing → Client-Side Only

NEXT.JS APP:
Browser → Next.js → File-Based Router → Server + Client
                  ↓
              API Routes → Database
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"The key difference: React apps are client-only - everything runs in the browser. Next.js apps have a server component, which means they can fetch data, connect to databases, and render pages on the server before sending them to the browser."

---

## 📊 **Slide 7: Routing - The Biggest Difference**

**Title:** How Routing Works

### **React (with React Router):**

```jsx
// You install: npm install react-router-dom
// You configure routes manually:

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/blog/:id" element={<BlogPost />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Manual configuration
- ❌ Easy to make mistakes
- ❌ No automatic code splitting
- ❌ All routes defined in one place

### **Next.js (File-Based):**

```
app/
├── page.tsx          → /
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx      → /about
└── blog/
    └── [id]/
        └── page.tsx  → /blog/:id
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Create file = create route
- ✅ Automatic code splitting
- ✅ Organized by feature
- ✅ No configuration needed

**Speaker Notes:**
"In React, you explicitly define every route in code. In Next.js, you just create a file. Want a /about page? Create app/about/page.tsx. Want dynamic routes? Use [brackets]. It's intuitive and scalable."

---

## 📊 **Slide 8: Rendering Methods**

**Title:** Where Does Your Page Get Built?

### **React: Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**

```
1. Browser requests page
2. Server sends empty HTML + JavaScript bundle
3. Browser downloads JavaScript
4. React builds the page
5. User sees content

Timeline: 2-5 seconds for first view
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Highly interactive after load
- ✅ Smooth transitions

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slow initial load
- ❌ Bad for SEO (search engines see empty page)
- ❌ Doesn't work without JavaScript

---

### **Next.js: Multiple Options**

**1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
```
1. Browser requests page
2. Server builds HTML
3. Server sends complete HTML
4. User sees content immediately
5. React "hydrates" for interactivity

Timeline: 0.5-1 second for first view
```

**2. Static Site Generation (SSG)**
```
1. Page built at build time
2. Stored as static HTML
3. Served instantly from CDN
4. No server processing needed

Timeline: 0.1-0.3 seconds (blazing fast!)
```

**3. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
```
- Static page with automatic rebuilds
- Updates every X seconds
- Best of both worlds
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Next.js gives you choices. Blog post that doesn't change? Use SSG. User dashboard with personal data? Use SSR. Product catalog that updates hourly? Use ISR. React only gives you CSR."

---

## 📊 **Slide 9: Code Comparison - Same Component**

**Title:** Writing Components (They're Almost Identical!)

### **React Component:**
```jsx
// src/components/BlogPost.jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function BlogPost() {
  const [post, setPost] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/posts/1')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setPost(data))
  }, [])

  if (!post) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
```

### **Next.js Component (Server Component):**
```jsx
// app/blog/[id]/page.tsx
async function getBlogPost(id) {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`)
  return res.json()
}

export default async function BlogPost({ params }) {
  const post = await getBlogPost(params.id)

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
```

**Key Differences:**
1. Next.js component is `async` (can await data)
2. No `useState` or `useEffect` needed for data fetching
3. No loading state needed - server waits
4. Better SEO (HTML includes content)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Notice how similar they look? You're still writing React. The difference: Next.js components can be async and fetch data on the server. This means users get a complete page immediately, not a loading spinner."

---

## 📊 **Slide 10: Development Experience**

**Title:** What's It Like to Build With Each?

### **React Setup:**
```bash
# Option 1: Create React App (deprecated)
npx create-react-app my-app
# Generates 32,000+ files, 200MB

# Option 2: Vite (modern)
npm create vite@latest my-app
# Still need to configure routing, etc.
```

**What you need to add:**
- Router (react-router-dom)
- API handling (axios or fetch)
- Build optimization (manual)
- Deployment configuration

---

### **Next.js Setup:**
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
# One command, includes everything

# What's included:
✅ Routing (file-based)
✅ API routes
✅ TypeScript support
✅ Optimizations (automatic)
✅ Deployment (one command to Vercel)
```

**Development Experience:**

| Task | React | Next.js |
|------|-------|---------|
| Create route | Edit router config | Create file |
| Add API | Setup Express | Create file in api/ |
| Data fetch | useState + useEffect | async function |
| Deploy | Configure build → Host | `vercel deploy` |

**Speaker Notes:**
"Next.js is opinionated - it makes decisions for you. Some developers don't like this (they want control), but for most projects, these decisions are good and save you time."

---

## 📊 **Slide 11: When to Use What?**

**Title:** Decision Framework

### **Choose React When:**
- 🎯 Building a **Single Page Application** (SPA)
- 🎯 SEO doesn't matter (internal dashboards, admin panels)
- 🎯 You already have a backend (Rails, Django, etc.)
- 🎯 You want maximum control over configuration
- 🎯 Project is small and simple

**Examples:**
- Admin dashboard
- Internal company tools
- Chrome extensions
- Interactive data visualizations

---

### **Choose Next.js When:**
- 🎯 Building a **marketing website** (SEO critical)
- 🎯 E-commerce site (SEO + performance critical)
- 🎯 Content-heavy site (blog, news, documentation)
- 🎯 You need a backend for your app
- 🎯 Performance is important
- 🎯 You want faster development

**Examples:**
- Company website
- E-commerce store
- Blog or news site
- SaaS application
- Portfolio site

---

### **Decision Tree:**

```
Do you need SEO?
├── No → Consider React
└── Yes → Use Next.js

Do you need a backend?
├── No → Consider React
└── Yes → Use Next.js

Is performance critical?
├── No → Either works
└── Yes → Use Next.js

Team size?
├── Large (>5 devs) → Next.js (consistency)
└── Small (1-3 devs) → Either works
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Most modern web apps benefit from Next.js. But if you're building a simple interactive tool that doesn't need SEO, React is perfectly fine. The key question: do search engines need to see your content?"

---

## 💬 **Think-Pair-Share Activity (5 minutes)**

**Instructions:**

1. **Think (1 min):** Consider these project ideas:
   - Personal portfolio website
   - Task management app (like Todoist)

2. **Pair (2 min):** Discuss with a partner: Would you use React or Next.js for each? Why?

3. **Share (2 min):** Volunteers share their reasoning

**Expected Answers:**
- **Portfolio:** Next.js (SEO for job applications)
- **Task app:** React (no SEO needed, login-only)
- **Blog:** Next.js (SEO critical)
- **Game:** React (interactive, no SEO)
- **Store:** Next.js (SEO + performance)

---

# Section 3: Exercise 1 - Create Your First Next.js App (15 minutes)

## 🎯 **Learning Objective**
Students will set up a Next.js project and understand its basic structure.

---

## 📊 **Slide 12: Hands-On Exercise 1**

**Title:** Let's Build Something!

**Exercise Goal:**
Create your first Next.js application and explore the project structure.

**Time:** 15 minutes

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up a Next.js project
- Understanding the folder structure
- Running the development server
- Making your first edit

---

## 📝 **Exercise 1: Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Create Next.js Project (3 minutes)**

**Instructions for students:**

```bash
# Open your terminal
# Navigate to where you want to create the project
cd ~/Desktop  # or wherever you prefer

# Create a new Next.js app
npx create-next-app@latest my-first-nextjs-app

# Answer the prompts:
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … No
✔ Would you like to use App Router? … Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? … No
```

**Wait for installation to complete (1-2 minutes)**

---

### **Step 2: Explore the Project Structure (3 minutes)**

**Open the project in VS Code:**

```bash
cd my-first-nextjs-app
code .
```

**Instructor Demo: Show the folder structure on screen**

```
my-first-nextjs-app/
├── app/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx       ← Root layout (wraps all pages)
│   └── page.tsx         ← Homepage (/)
├── public/
│   └── (static files like images)
├── node_modules/
├── .gitignore
├── next.config.js       ← Next.js configuration
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

**Key Points to Explain:**

1. **`app/` directory:**
   - This is where all your pages live
   - `page.tsx` = homepage
   - `layout.tsx` = wrapper for all pages

2. **`public/` directory:**
   - Static files (images, fonts, etc.)
   - Accessible at `/filename`

3. **`next.config.js`:**
   - Configuration for Next.js

**Checkpoint Question:** "Everyone see the `app` folder? That's where we'll spend most of our time."

---

### **Step 3: Run the Development Server (2 minutes)**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
  ▲ Next.js 14.x
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Ready in 2.3s
```

**Instructions:**
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see the Next.js welcome page

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Port 3000 already in use?** Kill the other process or use `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
- **Module not found errors?** Run `npm install` again

---

### **Step 4: Make Your First Edit (5 minutes)**

**Instructor: Live code this, students follow along**

**Open `app/page.tsx`** and replace everything with:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="text-center text-white">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold mb-4">
          My First Next.js App!
        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl mb-8">
          Welcome to the future of web development
        </p>
        <div className="text-sm opacity-75">
          <p>✨ Built with Next.js 14</p>
          <p>🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Save the file and watch the browser auto-refresh!**

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Hot reload (changes appear instantly)
- ✅ No manual refresh needed
- ✅ This is a React component
- ✅ Tailwind CSS classes for styling

---

### **Step 5: Understanding What Just Happened (2 minutes)**

**Instructor Explains:**

1. **This is still React:**
   - We wrote a React component
   - Used JSX syntax
   - Exported it as default

2. **But it's also Next.js:**
   - Filename (`page.tsx`) defines the route
   - No routing configuration needed
   - Automatically server-rendered

3. **Development Experience:**
   - Fast Refresh (instant updates)
   - TypeScript support (optional)
   - Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)

**Checkpoint Question:** "Everyone see their page? Try changing the text and watch it update!"

---

## 🧠 **Knowledge Check 3 (2 minutes)**

**Quick verbal quiz:**

1. **Q:** What command creates a new Next.js app?
   **A:** `npx create-next-app@latest`

2. **Q:** What file defines the homepage?
   **A:** `app/page.tsx`

3. **Q:** What happens when you save a file?
   **A:** Browser auto-refreshes (Hot Reload)

---

## 💡 **AI-Assisted Learning Moment**

**Slide:** Using AI to Learn Next.js

**Instructor says:**
"You'll notice we didn't explain every line of code. That's intentional. Let's use AI to learn!"

**Live Demo: Ask Claude/ChatGPT:**

```
I'm looking at this Next.js component:

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      <h1>My First Next.js App!</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

Explain to me like I'm a beginner:
1. Why is it called "Home" but the file is "page.tsx"?
2. What does "export default" mean?
3. What are these className things?
4. Can I use page.jsx instead of pages.tsx? Explain why or why not?
```

**Show AI Response and discuss**

**Encourage students:**
"Whenever you see something you don't understand, ask AI. It's like having a tutor 24/7. But always TEST what it tells you!"

---

# Section 4: Routing - React Router vs File-Based (20 minutes)

## 🎯 **Learning Objective**
Students will understand how routing works in Next.js and how it differs from React Router.

---

## 📊 **Slide 13: Routing Deep Dive**

**Title:** How URLs Map to Pages

**The Fundamental Concept:**
```
URL in browser → Which component to show?
```

**In traditional websites:**
```
example.com/about.html → about.html file
```

**In modern web apps:**
```
example.com/about → AboutPage component
```

**The question:** How does the app know which component to render?

---

## 📊 **Slide 14: React Router Approach**

**Title:** React Router - The Manual Way

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

**Configuration (all in one file):**

```jsx
// App.jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage'
import AboutPage from './pages/AboutPage'
import BlogPage from './pages/BlogPage'
import BlogPostPage from './pages/BlogPostPage'
import NotFoundPage from './pages/NotFoundPage'

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        <Link to="/blog">Blog</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
        <Route path="/blog" element={<BlogPage />} />
        <Route path="/blog/:id" element={<BlogPostPage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```

**Problems with this approach:**
- ❌ All routes in one place (doesn't scale)
- ❌ Easy to typo a path
- ❌ Manual import of every page
- ❌ No automatic code splitting
- ❌ Nested routes are complex

---

## 📊 **Slide 15: Next.js File-Based Routing**

**Title:** Next.js - Convention Over Configuration

**The Rule:**
```
File location = URL path
```

**Example Structure:**

```
app/
├── page.tsx                  → /
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx              → /about
├── blog/
│   ├── page.tsx              → /blog
│   └── [id]/
│       └── page.tsx          → /blog/123, /blog/456, etc.
├── dashboard/
│   ├── page.tsx              → /dashboard
│   ├── settings/
│   │   └── page.tsx          → /dashboard/settings
│   └── profile/
│       └── page.tsx          → /dashboard/profile
└── not-found.tsx             → 404 page
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No configuration file
- ✅ Organized by feature
- ✅ Automatic code splitting
- ✅ Easy to understand structure
- ✅ Scales to hundreds of routes

---

## 📊 **Slide 16: Dynamic Routes**

**Title:** Handling Variable URLs

### **The Challenge:**
```
You have 1000 blog posts
Do you create 1000 files? NO!
```

### **Solution: Dynamic Segments**

**Syntax:** Use `[brackets]` for variable parts

```
app/
└── blog/
    └── [id]/
        └── page.tsx
```

**This matches:**
- `/blog/1`
- `/blog/hello-world`
- `/blog/anything-here`

### **Accessing the Parameter:**

```tsx
// app/blog/[id]/page.tsx
export default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Post ID: {params.id}</h1>
      <p>This page is dynamically generated!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**What happens:**
1. User visits `/blog/hello-world`
2. Next.js matches the `[id]` segment
3. Component receives `params.id = "hello-world"`
4. You use that ID to fetch data

## 📊 **Slide 17: Advanced Routing Patterns**

**Title:** More Routing Tricks

### **1. Catch-All Routes**

```
app/
└── docs/
    └── [...slug]/
        └── page.tsx
```

**Matches:**
- `/docs/a`
- `/docs/a/b`
- `/docs/a/b/c/d/e`

**Use case:** Documentation with nested sections

---

### **2. Optional Catch-All**

```
app/
└── shop/
    └── [[...slug]]/
        └── page.tsx
```

**Matches:**
- `/shop` (empty slug)
- `/shop/electronics`
- `/shop/electronics/phones`

---

### **3. Route Groups (Organization)**

```
app/
├── (marketing)/
│   ├── about/
│   │   └── page.tsx        → /about
│   └── contact/
│       └── page.tsx        → /contact
└── (shop)/
    ├── products/
    │   └── page.tsx        → /products
    └── cart/
        └── page.tsx        → /cart
```

**Note:** Parentheses don't affect URLs (just organization)

---

## 📊 **Slide 18: Navigation in Next.js**

**Title:** Moving Between Pages

### **The Link Component:**

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
      <Link href="/blog/my-first-post">First Post</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

**Why use Link instead of `<a>`?**
- ✅ Client-side navigation (faster)
- ✅ Prefetching (next page loads before you click)
- ✅ No full page reload
- ✅ Preserves React state

---

### **Programmatic Navigation:**

```tsx
'use client'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

export default function LoginButton() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleLogin = async () => {
    // Do login logic
    await login()
    
    // Redirect to dashboard
    router.push('/dashboard')
  }

  return <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
}
```

---

## 📊 **Slide 19: Comparison Table**

**Title:** React Router vs Next.js Routing

| Feature | React Router | Next.js |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Setup** | Install + configure | Built-in |
| **Route definition** | Centralized (App.jsx) | File-based |
| **Dynamic routes** | `:param` in path string | `[param]` in folder name |
| **Nested routes** | `<Outlet />` components | Folder nesting |
| **Code splitting** | Manual (lazy load) | Automatic |
| **Prefetching** | Manual | Automatic |
| **404 handling** | Catch-all route | `not-found.tsx` |
| **Loading states** | Manual | `loading.tsx` |

# Section 5: Exercise 2 - Build a Multi-Page App (15 minutes)

## 🎯 **Learning Objective**
Students will create multiple pages with navigation and dynamic routes.

---

## 📊 **Slide 20: Exercise 2 - Multi-Page Portfolio**

**Title:** Let's Build a Multi-Page App!

**Exercise Goal:**
Create a simple portfolio website with:
- Homepage
- About page
- Projects page
- Individual project pages (dynamic)

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

## 📝 **Exercise 2: Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Part 1: Create the Page Structure (5 minutes)**

**Students follow along:**

```bash
# In your my-first-nextjs-app project
# Create new folders and files

# Structure to create:
app/
├── page.tsx (already exists - homepage)
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx
├── projects/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [id]/
│       └── page.tsx
└── layout.tsx (already exists)
```

**Step-by-step commands:**

```bash
# Create about page
mkdir app/about
touch app/about/page.tsx

# Create projects pages
mkdir app/projects
touch app/projects/page.tsx
mkdir app/projects/[id]
touch app/projects/[id]/page.tsx
```

---

### **Part 2: Build the Navigation (3 minutes)**

**Update `app/layout.tsx`** to add navigation:

```tsx
import './globals.css'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Navigation Bar */}
        <nav className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4">
          <div className="container mx-auto flex gap-6">
            <Link href="/" className="hover:text-blue-400">
              Home
            </Link>
            <Link href="/about" className="hover:text-blue-400">
              About
            </Link>
            <Link href="/projects" className="hover:text-blue-400">
              Projects
            </Link>
          </div>
        </nav>

        {/* Page Content */}
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

**Key concept:** Layout wraps all pages, so navigation appears everywhere

---

### **Part 3: Build the Homepage (2 minutes)**

        Welcome to My Portfolio
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        I'm a web developer learning Next.js!
      </p>
      <a 
        href="/projects"
        className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700"
      >
        View My Projects
      </a>
    </div>

        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Interests</h2>
        <p>
          Web development, AI, and building cool stuff!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

### **Part 5: Build the Projects List Page (3 minutes)**

**Create `app/projects/page.tsx`:**

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'

// Sample project data (hardcoded for now)
const projects = [

  },
]

export default function Projects() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">My Projects</h1>
      
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        {projects.map((project) => (
          <Link
            key={project.id}
            href={`/projects/${project.id}`}
            className="border rounded-lg p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow"
          >
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">{project.title}</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">{project.description}</p>
            <p className="text-blue-600 mt-4">View details →</p>
          </Link>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

### **Part 6: Build the Dynamic Project Page (5 minutes)**

**Create `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`:**

```tsx
// Sample project details (in a real app, this would come from a database)
const projectDetails: Record<string, any> = {
  'todo-app': {

export default function ProjectDetail({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const project = projectDetails[params.id]

  // Handle project not found
  if (!project) {
    return (
      <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Project Not Found</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Sorry, we couldn't find a project with ID: {params.id}

# Section 6: Rendering Methods (15 minutes)

## 🎯 **Learning Objective**
Students will understand CSR, SSR, and SSG, and when to use each.

---

## 📊 **Slide 21: The Rendering Spectrum**

**Title:** Where Does Your HTML Get Built?

**The Question:**
When a user visits your website, where does the HTML come from?

**Three Answers:**
1. **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** - Browser builds it
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Server builds it per request
3. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Built once at build time

---

## 📊 **Slide 22: Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**

**Title:** How React Works by Default

### **The Process:**

```
1. Browser requests example.com
   ↓
2. Server sends empty HTML + JavaScript bundle
   <html>
     <body>
       <div id="root"></div>
       <script src="bundle.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ↓
3. Browser downloads JavaScript (2-5 seconds)
   ↓
4. React runs and builds the page
   ↓
5. User finally sees content
```

### **Pros:**
- ✅ Highly interactive after load
- ✅ Smooth transitions between pages
- ✅ Feels like a native app

### **Cons:**
- ❌ Slow initial load
- ❌ Blank screen while loading
- ❌ Search engines see empty page (bad SEO)
- ❌ Requires JavaScript enabled

### **Best For:**
- Admin dashboards
- Web apps behind login
- Interactive tools (games, calculators)

---

## 📊 **Slide 23: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

**Title:** Next.js Can Render on the Server

### **The Process:**

```
1. Browser requests example.com/products
   ↓
2. Server runs React
   - Fetches data from database
   - Builds complete HTML
   ↓
3. Server sends ready HTML
   <html>
     <body>
       <h1>Products</h1>
       <div>Product 1</div>
       <div>Product 2</div>
       ...
     </body>
   </html>
   ↓
4. Browser shows content immediately (0.5s)
   ↓
5. JavaScript loads for interactivity
```

### **Pros:**
- ✅ Fast initial load
- ✅ Perfect for SEO (search engines see content)
- ✅ Works without JavaScript
- ✅ Always fresh data

### **Cons:**
- ❌ Server does work on every request (slower than static)
- ❌ More expensive to host
- ❌ Requires server (can't use CDN)

### **Best For:**
- E-commerce product pages
- User dashboards (personalized content)
- News sites (constantly updating)
- Any page that needs fresh data

---

## 📊 **Slide 24: Static Site Generation (SSG)**

**Title:** Build Once, Serve Forever

### **The Process:**

```
1. At BUILD time (npm run build):
   - Next.js runs all pages
   - Fetches data
   - Generates static HTML files
   - Stores them
   ↓
2. When user requests example.com/about:
   - Server sends pre-built HTML (0.1s)
   - No processing needed
   ↓
3. Browser shows content instantly
```

### **Pros:**
- ✅ Blazing fast (served from CDN)
- ✅ Perfect SEO
- ✅ Cheap to host (static files)
- ✅ Scales to millions of users

### **Cons:**
- ❌ Data can be stale
- ❌ Need to rebuild to update content
- ❌ Build time increases with pages

### **Best For:**
- Blog posts
- Marketing pages
- Documentation
- Any content that doesn't change often

---

## 📊 **Slide 25: Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

**Title:** Best of Both Worlds

### **The Process:**

```
1. Build static pages at build time
   ↓
2. Serve static HTML (fast)
   ↓
3. After X seconds, regenerate in background
   ↓
4. Next request gets updated page
```

### **Example:**

```tsx
// This page regenerates every 60 seconds
export const revalidate = 60

export default async function ProductPage() {
  const product = await fetchProduct()
  return <div>{product.name}</div>
}
```

### **Use Case:**
- Product catalog (prices update hourly)
- Blog with comments (regenerate when new comment)
- Weather dashboard (update every 10 minutes)

---

## 📊 **Slide 26: Code Examples**

**Title:** How to Control Rendering in Next.js

### **1. Static (SSG) - Default**

```tsx
// app/blog/page.tsx
// Builds at build time
export default function Blog() {
  return <div>Blog Posts</div>
}
```

### **2. Dynamic (SSR) - Force Fresh Data**

```tsx
// app/dashboard/page.tsx
// Fetches on every request
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export default async function Dashboard() {
  const data = await fetchUserData() // Runs on server
  return <div>{data.name}</div>
}
```

### **3. ISR - Revalidate Periodically**

```tsx
// app/products/page.tsx
// Regenerates every 60 seconds
export const revalidate = 60

export default async function Products() {
  const products = await fetchProducts()
  return <div>{products.map(...)}</div>
}
```

---

## 📊 **Slide 27: Decision Matrix**

**Title:** Which Rendering Method Should You Use?

| Question | If YES, use... |
|----------|---------------|
| Does SEO matter? | SSR or SSG |
| Does data change constantly? | SSR |
| Is it the same for all users? | SSG |
| Can data be 10 minutes old? | ISR |
| Is it personalized per user? | SSR |
| Is it behind authentication? | CSR |
| Do you have 10,000+ pages? | SSG + ISR |

### **Examples:**

| Page Type | Rendering | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Blog post | SSG | Doesn't change, SEO matters |
| Product page | ISR | Prices update, SEO matters |
| User dashboard | SSR | Personalized, needs fresh data |
| Admin panel | CSR | Behind login, no SEO needed |
| Homepage | SSG | Same for everyone, SEO critical |
| Search results | SSR | Dynamic, needs fresh data |

---

### **Pro Tip:**
"When in doubt, choose Next.js. You can always use it like React (CSR), but you have SSR/SSG available when you need it."

---

## 📊 **Slide 31: Common Mistakes to Avoid**

**Title:** Don't Do This!

### **Mistake 1: Using Next.js for Everything**
❌ Don't use Next.js for:
- Mobile apps (use React Native)
- Electron apps (use React)
- Very simple one-pagers (use HTML)

### **Mistake 2: Using React When You Need SEO**
❌ Don't use vanilla React for:
- Company blogs
- E-commerce sites
- Public documentation

Use Next.js SSG instead!

### **Mistake 3: Using SSR When SSG Would Work**
❌ Don't use SSR for:
- Content that doesn't change
- Pages without personalization

Use SSG - it's faster and cheaper!

### **Mistake 4: Not Using the Right Tool**
Consider:
- **Astro** - For content sites (faster than Next.js)
- **Remix** - For complex data requirements
- **Gatsby** - For GraphQL-heavy sites
