# Micro-Milestones and Public Wins
Introduce Micro-Milestones and Public Wins:
Action: Break one large assignment into 3-5 tiny, sequential steps. Each step must be completable in 30-45 minutes.

> **Example:** Instead of "**Build the To-Do App**," use:
> - Get the static HTML/CSS to render. 
(Competency: basic file structure)
> - Render a dynamic list of items from a hard-coded array. (Competency: basic map function)
> - Add an input field and button to add a new item. (Competency: State management and event handlers)

***Outcome***: Students experience frequent, tangible success, which is the most powerful motivator for low-confidence learners.
